# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

BEEF SQUASHER

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A 2D platform fighting game, similar to the game Brawlhalla

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This game will be developed in python using pygame. The game will need to have a background picture, a platform that the characters stand on. At least two characters where one is played by the user, the other will be a bot, or static character that the user can perform combat on.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Have at least two characters displayed on the screen that can perform movement and some combat.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Have a bot that can be interactive with the user playing the game

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I want to be able to have multiple characters with different skins, allow local and online play and potentially implement weapons of some sort.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn how to use pygame for this project. Learn how to create a background for the game, with a platform that the characters can stand on. How to create animations for attacks and movements. If the character strikes another character, there needs to be some type of input such that it knows an attack was made and there was a hit. If its a miss, then nothing happens.
